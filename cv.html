            <p class="p1"> I have been a professional developer since 2001., participating in the development of large scale server systems, desktop applications, and standalone kiosk devices. In the process, I have been using a variety of languages and technologies, including Elixir, Erlang, JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, C# and .NET, C++ and MFC, Microsoft SQL Server.
            </p>

            <p class="p1">I hold a <a href="http://www.fer.unizg.hr/en/education/msc_study/comp">Master of Science degree in Computing</a>, (graduated in 2002.) at the <a href="http://www.fer.unizg.hr/en">Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing</a>, Zagreb, Croatia. I am fluent in English and German.</p>

            <h5>Sports betting web site</h5>
            <p class="p">(2008-present)</p>
            <p class="p2">
              One of the largest Croatian sport betting sites, that on a daily basis attracts about 200,000 visitors and has more than million page views. I have been involved in all areas of the development, ranging from the back-end server code, written mostly in Ruby on Rails, to the client side JavaScript running in browsers.<br/><br/>

              As a special sub-project for this site, I have almost single-handedly developed the support for live betting feature, that allows clients to place bets on the sport events currently in play. This is a separate sub-system, that in production serves more than 5,000 simultaneous players, handling over 2,000 request per second. The back-end is powered by the combination of Erlang and Ruby, while the client side code consists of complex JavaScript logic. Starting from 2013., I have been using Elixir to develop new back-end code, and replace some of the existing Erlang code.

            <h5>Sports betting terminal</h5>
            <p class="p">(2007-2011)</p>
            <p class="p2">
              A standalone kiosk device that is deployed throughout the country, and makes it possible for people to place sporting bets, in places such as bars, coffee shops, or casinos. Internally, the application is a web server, while on the front-end it is run inside a full screen browser.
              <br/><br/>
              I have been involved in the project, practically from the first day, contributing to the various parts of the system. Notable tasks include development of native C++ components that talk to external devices (note and coin acceptor, bar code reader, printer), integrating those components into the Firefox browser, and communicating with them from the JavaScript code. In addition, I was responsible for setting up the Windows XP Embedded system that powers each device. Finally, I was involved in the development of the back-end Ruby on Rails system.

            <h5>Tax return application</h5>
            <p class="p">(2001-2007)</p>
            <p class="p2">
              An end-user Windows application that was at the time published in about 700,000 copies annually. The project was a coordinated effort of teams from different countries, lead by the team from Germany. The code base was a legacy MFC based C++ code, and later new parts were being developed in C#.<br/><br/>

              I was a part of the Croatian group of about 5 developers, that reimplemented the UI, introducing embedded HTML and JavaScript to modernize the entire application. In addition, we developed various features for the application, and created the separate tool that made it possible for the business team to design input forms, bind fields to variables, and develop business rules.<br/><br/>

              In addition to standard development tasks, I also became the lead developer of the Croatian team, being in charge of organizing the team, discussing the requirements with the German team, producing estimates, monitoring the progress of the entire team, and participating in the architectural discussions.

          <div id="otherright">
            <p class="p2">I have occasionally given talks at local Croatian conferences. As a participant, I have attended various international conferences such as Erlang User Conference, OOPSLA, and TechEd.<br/><br/>
            Occasionally, I talk about Elixir and Erlang on <a href="http://theerlangelist.com">The Erlangelist</a> blog. I developed a couple of open source libraries that are available on my <a href="https://github.com/sasa1977">GitHub repository</a>.</p>
